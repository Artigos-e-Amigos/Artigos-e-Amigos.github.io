This website is the mathematical companion to the [Numerical Tours of Data Sciences](http://www.numerical-tours.com).

Its main goal is to host two book projects:
- the [Mathematical Foundations of Data Sciences](../book/), which are course notes ;
- the [An Introduction to Imaging Sciences](../book-basics/), which is a general audience text on imaging.

It also contains a repository of slides which [covers the topics of the book](../slides).
