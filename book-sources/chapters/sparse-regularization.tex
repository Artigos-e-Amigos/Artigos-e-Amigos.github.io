\section{Sparsity Priors}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Ideal sparsity prior.}

As detailed in Chapter \ref{chap-approximation}, it is possible to use an orthogonal basis $\Bb = \{ \psi_m \}_m$ to efficiently approximate an image $f$ in a given class $f \in \Th$ with a few atoms from $\Bb$. 

To measure the complexity of an approximation with $\Bb$, we consider the $\lzero$ prior, which counts the number of non-zero coefficients in $\Bb$
\eq{
	\Jz(f) \eqdef \#\enscond{m}{\dotp{f}{\psi_m} \neq 0}
	\qwhereq
	x_m = \dotp{f}{\psi_m}.
}
One often also denote it as the $\lzero$ ``pseudo-norm''
\eq{
	\normz{x} \eqdef \Jz(f).
}
which we treat here as an ideal sparsity measure for the coefficients $x$ of $f$ in $\Bb$.

Natural images are not exactly composed of a few atoms, but they can be well approximated by a function $f_M$ with a small ideal sparsity $M=\Jz(f)$. In particular, the best $M$-term approximation defined in \eqref{eq-nonlinear-approx} is defined by
\eq{
	f_M = \sum_{ |\dotp{f}{\psi_m}|>T } \dotp{f}{\psi_m} \psi_m
	\qwhereq
	M = \#\enscond{m}{|\dotp{f}{\psi_m}|>T}.
}
As detailed in Section \ref{sec-signal-models}, discontinuous images with bounded variation have a fast decay of the approximation error $\norm{f-f_M}$. Natural images $f$ are well approximated by images with a small value of the ideal sparsity prior $\Jz$.

Figure \ref{fig-sparsity-wav} shows an examples of decomposition of a natural image in a wavelet basis, $\psi_m = \psi_{j,n}^\om$ $m=(j,n,\om)$. This shows that most $\dotp{f}{\psi_m}$ are small, and hence the decomposition is quite sparse.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Convex relaxation}

Unfortunately, the ideal sparsity prior $\Jz$ is difficult to handle numerically because $\Jz(f)$ is not a convex function of $f$. For instance, if $f$ and $g$ have non-intersecting supports of there coefficients in $\Bb$, then $\Jz( (f+g)/2 ) = \Jz(f)+\Jz(g)$, which shows the highly non-convex behavior of $\Jz$.

This ideal sparsity $\Jz$ is thus not amenable to minimization, which is an issue to solve general inverse problems considered in Section \ref{chap-invpbm}. 

We consider a family of $\ell^q$ priors for $q>0$, intended to approximate the ideal prior $\Jz$ 
\eq{
	J_q(f) = \displaystyle \sum_m |\dotp{f}{\psi_m}|^q.
}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig-sparsity-lq}, the unit balls in $\RR^2$ associated to these priors are shrinking toward the axes, which corresponds to the unit ball for the $\lzero$ pseudo norm. In some sense, the $J_q$ priors are becoming closer to $\Jz$ as $q$ tends to zero, and thus $J_q$ favors sparsity for small $q$.


\myfigure{
\image{variational}{1}{sparsity-lq-balls}
}{%
	$\ell^q$ balls $\enscond{x}{J_q(x) \leq 1}$ for varying $q$.
}{fig-sparsity-lq}


The prior $J_q$ is convex if and only if $q \geq 1$. To reach the highest degree of sparsity while using a convex prior, we consider the $\lun$ sparsity prior $\Ju$, which is thus defined as 
\eql{\label{eq-dfn-lun-prior}
	\Ju(f) = \norm{(\dotp{f}{\psi_m})}_1 = \sum_m |\dotp{f}{\psi_m}|.
}
In the following, we consider discrete orthogonal bases $\Bb = \{\psi_m\}_{m=0}^{N-1}$ of $\RR^N$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Sparse Regularization and Thresholding}

Given some orthogonal basis $\{\psi_m\}_m$ of $\RR^N$, the denoising by regularization \eqref{eq-regul-denoising} is written using the sparsity $\Jz$ and $\Ju$ as 
\eq{
	f^\star = \uargmin{g \in \RR^N} \frac{1}{2} \norm{f-g}^2 + \la J_q(f)
}
for $q=0$ or $q=1$. It can be re-written in the orthogonal basis as
\eq{
	f^\star = \sum_m x^\star_m \psi_m
}
\eq{
	\qwhereq
	x^{\star} = \uargmin{y \in \RR^N} \sum_m \frac{1}{2} |x_m-y_m|^2 + \la |y_m|^q
}
where $x_m \eqdef \dotp{f}{\psi_m}$, $y_m \eqdef \dotp{g}{\psi_m}$, and where we use the following slight abuse of notation for $q=0$
\eq{
	\foralls u \in \RR, \quad
	|u|^0=
	\choice{
		0 \qifq u=0, \\ 1 \quad \text{otherwise.} 
	}
}
Each coefficients of the denoised image is the solution of a 1-D optimization problem
\eql{\label{eq-var-1D-spars}
	x_m^\star = \uargmin{u \in \RR}  \frac{1}{2} |x_m-u|^2 + \la |u|^q
}
and the following proposition this optimization is solved exactly in closed form using thresholding.

\begin{prop}\label{prop-equiv-sparse-thresh}
One has
\eql{\label{eq-equiv-sparse-thresh}
	x^{\star}_m = S_T^q( x_m )
	\qwhereq 
	\choice{
		T = \sqrt{2 \la} \qforq q=0,\\
		T = \la \qforq q=1,
	}
}
where 
\eql{\label{eq-hard-thresh}
	\foralls u \in \RR, \quad
	S_T^0(u) \eqdef
	\choice{
		0 \qifq |u| < T, \\
		u \quad\text{otherwise}	
	}
} 
is the hard thresholding introduced in~\eqref{eq-hard-thresh-denoise}, and 
\eql{\label{eq-soft-thresh}
	\foralls u \in \RR, \quad
	S_T^1(u) \eqdef  \sign(u) ( |u|-T )_+
} 
is the soft thresholding introduced in~\eqref{eq-soft-thresh-denoise}.
\end{prop}

	
\begin{proof}
	One needs to solve~\eqref{eq-var-1D-spars}. Figure~\ref{fig-varspars}, left shows the function $\norm{x-y}^2+T^2 \norm{x}_0$, and the minimum is clearly at $x=0$ when $T \geq y$, and at $x=y$ otherwise. This is thus a hard thresholding with threshold $T^2=2\la$. 
	%
	Figure~\eqref{fig-varspars}, right, shows the evolution with $\la$ of the function $\frac{1}{2}\norm{x-y}^2+\la |x|$. 
	% 
	For $x>0$, one has $F'(x)=x-y+\la$ wich is $0$ at $x=y-\la$.
	The minimum is at $x=y-\la$ for $\la \leq y$, and stays at $0$ for all $\la>y$. 
\end{proof}

One thus has
\eq{
	f_{\la,q} = \sum_m S_T^q( \dotp{f}{\psi_m} ) \psi_m.
}
As detailed in Section \ref{sec-nl-denoising-thresh}, these denoising methods has the advantage that the threshold is simple to set for Gaussian white noise $w$ of variance $\si^2$. Theoretical values indicated that $T = \sqrt{2\log(N)} \si$ is asymptotically optimal, see Section \ref{subsec-minimax-denoise}. In practice, one should choose $T \approx 3\si$ for hard thresholding ($\lzero$ regularization), and $T \approx 3\si/2$ for soft thresholding ($\lun$ regularization), see Figure \ref{fig-wavthresh-2d}.

\section{Sparse Regularization of Inverse Problems}
\label{sec-sparse-ip}

Sparse $\lun$ regularization in an orthogonal basis $\{\psi_m\}_m$ of $\RR^N$ makes use of the $\Ju$ prior defined in \eqref{eq-dfn-lun-prior}, so that the inversion is obtained by solving the following convex program
\eql{\label{eq-bpdn}
	f_\la \in \uargmin{f \in \RR^N} \frac{1}{2}\norm{y-\Phi f}^2 + \la \sum_m |\dotp{f}{\psi_m}|.
}
This corresponds to the basis pursuit denoising for sparse approximation introduced by Chen, Donoho and Saunders in \cite{chen-basis-pursuit}. The resolution of \eqref{eq-bpdn} can be perform using an iterative thresholding algorithm as detailed in Section \ref{subsec-proximal-ip}. 

%%%
\paragraph{Analysis vs. synthesis priors.}

When the set of atoms $\Psi = \{\psi_m\}_{m=1}^Q$ is non-orthognal (and might even be redundant in the case $Q>N$), there is two distincts way to generalizes problem~\eqref{eq-bpdn}, which we formulate as in~\eqref{}, by introducing a generic convex prior $J$
\eql{\label{eq-regul-generic}
	f_\la \in \uargmin{f \in \RR^N} \frac{1}{2}\norm{y-\Phi f}^2 + \la J(f).
}
In the following, with a slight abuse of notation, we denote the ``analysis'' and ``synthesis'' operator as
\eq{
	\Psi : x \in \RR^Q \mapsto \Psi x = \sum_m x_m \psi_m
	\qandq
	\Psi^* : f \in \RR^N \mapsto ( \dotp{f}{\psi_m} )_{m=1}^Q \in \RR^Q.
}

The so-called analysis-type prior is simply measuring the sparsity of the correlations with the atoms in the dictionary
\eql{\label{eq-sparsity-analysis}
	J_1^{\text{A}}(f) \eqdef \sum_m |\dotp{f}{\psi_m}| = \norm{\Psi^* f}_1.
}
The so-called synthesis-type priori in contrast measure the sparsity of the sparsest expansion of $f$ in $\Psi$, i.e.
\eql{\label{eq-sparsity-synthesis}
	J_1^{\text{S}}(f) \eqdef \umin{x \in \RR^q, \Psi x = f} \norm{x}_1.  
}
While the analysis regularization~\eqref{eq-sparsity-analysis} seems simpler to handle, it is actually the contrary. Solving~\eqref{eq-regul-generic} with $J=J_1^{\text{A}}$ is in fact quite involved, and necessitate typically primal-dual algorithm as detailed in Chapter~\ref{chap-conv-duality}. Furthermore, the theoretical study of the performance of the resulting regularization method is mostly an open problem. 

We thus now focus on the synthesis regularization problem $J=J_1^{\text{S}}$, and we re-write~\eqref{eq-regul-generic} conveniently as $f_\la = \Psi x_\la$ where $x_\la$ is any solution of the following Basis Pursuit Denoising problem
\eql{\label{eq-lasso-lagr-ip}
	x_\la \in \uargmin{x \in \RR^Q} \frac{1}{2\la} \norm{y-Ax}^2 + \norm{x}_1
} 
where we introduced the following matrix
\eq{
	A \eqdef \Phi \Psi \in \RR^{P \times Q}. 
}
As $\la \rightarrow 0$, we consider the following limit constrained problem
\eql{\label{eq-lasso-constr-ip}
	x^\star = \uargmin{A x = y} \norm{x}_1
} 
and the signal is recovered as $f^\star=\Psi x^\star \in \RR^N$.


% This can be recasted as a convex linear program, which can in turn by solved by various solver such as simplex, interior points, or Douglas-Rachford iterations.

\section{Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm}
\label{subsec-proximal-ip}

This section details an iterative algorithm that compute a solution of~\eqref{eq-lasso-lagr-ip}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Noiseless Recovery as a Linear Program}
\label{eq-linearprog-lasso}

Before detailing this methods, which only deal with the case $\la>0$, let us note that in the noiseless settig, $\la=0$ and~\eqref{eq-lasso-constr-ip} is actually equivalent to a linear program. Indeed, decomposing $a=x_+-x_-$ with $(x_+,x_-) \in (\RR_+^Q)^2$, one has
\eql{\label{eq-lin-prog-lasso}
	x^\star = \uargmin{(x_+,x_-) \in (\RR_+^Q)^2} \enscond{ \dotp{x_+}{\ones_Q}+\dotp{x_-}{\ones_Q} }{ y = A(x_+ - x_-) }.
}
which is a linear program. For small to medium scale problem ($Q$ of the order of a few thousands) it can be solved using the simplex algorithm or interior point methods. 
%
For large scale problems such as those encountered in imaging or machine learning, this is not possible, and one has to ressort to simpler first order schemes. A possible option is the Douglas-Rachford splitting scheme, which is detailed in Section~\ref{}.
%
Let us however stress that the constrained problem~\eqref{eq-lasso-constr-ip}, because of its polyhedral (linear) nature, is in fact harder to solve than the penalized problem~\eqref{eq-lasso-lagr-ip} that we now target. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Projected Gradient Descent for $\ell^1$.}

As a first practical example to solve~\eqref{eq-lasso-lagr-ip}, we will show how to use the projected gradient descent method, which is analyzed in detailed in Section~\ref{sec-proj-grad}.
%
Similarly to~\eqref{eq-lin-prog-lasso}, we remap~\eqref{eq-lasso-lagr-ip} as the resolution of a constraint minimization problem of the form~\eqref{eq-constr} where here $\Cc$ is a positivity constraint and
\eq{
	u=(u_+,u_-) \in (\RR^Q)^2, \quad
	\Cc=(\RR_+^Q)^2, 
	\qandq
	\Ee(u) = \frac{1}{2}\norm{ \Phi(u_+-u_-) - y }^2 + \la \dotp{u_+}{\ones_Q} +\la \dotp{u_-}{\ones_Q}.
}
The projection on $\Cc$ is here simple to compute
\eq{
	\Proj_{(\RR_+^Q)^2}(u_+,u_-) = ((u_+)_\oplus,(u_-)_\oplus)
	\qwhereq
	(r)_\oplus \eqdef \max(r,0), 
}
and the gradient reads
\eq{
	\nabla \Ee(u_+,u_-) =  ( \eta + \la \ones_Q , -\eta + \la \ones_Q) 
	\qwhereq
	\eta = \Phi^*( \Phi(u_+-u_-) - y )
}

Denoting $\it{u} = (\it{u_+},\it{u_-})$ and $\it{x} \eqdef \it{u_+}-\it{u_-}$, the iterate of the projected gradient descent algorithm~\eqref{eq-proj-grad-desc} read
\eq{
	\iit{u_+} \eqdef \pa{ \it{u_+} - \tau_\ell ( \it{\eta} + \la  ) }_\oplus
	\qandq
	\iit{u_-} \eqdef \pa{ \it{u_-} - \tau_\ell ( -\it{\eta} + \la  ) }_\oplus
} 
where $\it{\eta} \eqdef \Phi^*( \Phi \it{x} - y )$.

Theorem~\ref{thm-proj-grad} ensures that $\it{u} \rightarrow u^\star$ a solution to~\eqref{eq-constr} if 
\eq{
	\foralls \ell, \quad
	0 < \tau_{\min} <  \tau_\ell < \tau_{\max} < \frac{2}{\norm{\Phi}^2},
}
and thus $\it{x} \rightarrow x^\star = u_+^\star-u_-^\star$ which is thus a solution to~\eqref{eq-lasso-lagr-ip}. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Iterative Soft Thresholding and Forward Backward}
\label{sec-ista}

A drawback of this projected gradient descent scheme is that it necessitate to store $2Q$ coefficients. A closely related method, which comes with exactly the same convergence guarantees and rate, is the so called ``iterative soft thresholding algorithm'' (ISTA). 
%
This algorithm was derived by several authors, among which \cite{figueiredo-nowak-em,daubechies-iterated}, and belongs to the general family of forward-backward splitting in proximal iterations \cite{combettes-proximal}, which we detail in Section~\ref{sec-fb}.

For the sake of simplicity, let us derive this algorithm in the special case of $\ell^1$ by surrogate function minimization. 
%
We aim at minimizing~\eqref{eq-bpdn} 
\eq{
	\Ee(x) \eqdef \frac{1}{2} \norm{y-Ax}^2 + \la \norm{x}_1
}
and we introduce for any fixed $x'$ the function 
\eq{
	\Ee_\tau(x,x') \eqdef \Ee(x) - \frac{1}{2}\norm{Ax-Ax'}^2 + \frac{1}{2\tau}\norm{x-x'}^2.
}
We notice that $\Ee(x,x)=0$ and one has 
\eq{
	K(x,x') \eqdef - \frac{1}{2}\norm{Ax-Ax'}^2 + \frac{1}{2\tau}\norm{x-x'} = 
	\frac{1}{2}\dotp{ \pa{\frac{1}{\tau}\Id_N-A^*A} (x-x') }{x-x'}.
}
This quantity $K(x,x')$ is positive if $\la_{\max}(A^*A) \leq 1/\tau$ (maximum eigenvalue), i.e. $\tau \leq 1/\norm{A}_{\text{op}}^2$, where we recall that $\norm{A}_{\text{op}} = \si_{\max}(A)$ is the operator (algebra) norm.
%
This shows that $\Ee_\tau(x,x')$ is a valid surrogate functional, in the sense that
\eq{
	\Ee(x) \leq \Ee_\tau(x,x'), \quad
	\Ee_\tau(x,x')=0, \qandq
	\Ee(\cdot)-\Ee_\tau(\cdot,x') \text{ is smooth.} 
}
This leads to define
\eql{\label{eq-ista-surrog}
	\iit{x} \eqdef \uargmin{x} \Ee_{\tau_\ell}(x,\it{x})
}
which by construction satisfies 
\eq{
	\Ee(\iit{x}) \leq \Ee(\it{x}).
}

\begin{prop}
	The iterates $\it{x}$ defined by~\eqref{eq-ista-surrog} satisfy
	\eql{\label{eq-ista}
		\iit{x} = \Ss^1_{\la\tau_\ell}\pa{
			\it{x} - \tau_\ell A^*( A \it{x} - y ) 
		}
	}
	where $\Ss^1_\la(x) = (  S^1_\la(x_m) )_m$ where $S^1_\la(r) = \sign(r) (|r|-\la)_\oplus$ is the soft thresholding operator defined in~\eqref{eq-soft-thresh}. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	One has 
	\begin{align*}
		\Ee_\tau(x,x') &= \frac{1}{2}\norm{Ax-y}^2 - \frac{1}{2}\norm{Ax-Ax'}^2 + \frac{1}{2\tau}\norm{x-x'}^2 + \la \norm{x}_1 \\
			& = C + \frac{1}{2}\norm{Ax}^2-\frac{1}{2}\norm{Ax}^2+\frac{1}{2\tau}\norm{x}^2
			- \dotp{Ax}{y} + \dotp{Ax}{Ax'} - \frac{1}{\tau}\dotp{x}{x'}
			+ \la \norm{x}_1 \\
			& = C + \frac{1}{2\tau}\norm{x}^2 + \dotp{x}{ -A^*y+AA^*x'-\frac{1}{\tau}x' } + \la \norm{x}_1 \\
			&= C' + \frac{1}{\tau} \pa{
				\norm{ x - \pa{ x'-\tau A^*(Ax'-y) } }^2 + \tau \la \norm{x}_1.
			}
	\end{align*}
	Proposition~\eqref{prop-equiv-sparse-thresh} shows that the minimizer of $\Ee_\tau(x,x')$ is thus 
	indeed $\Ss^1_{\la\tau}( x' - \tau_\ell A^*( A x' - y ) )$.
\end{proof}

Of course, these iterations~\eqref{eq-ista} are the same as the FB iterates~\eqref{eq-fb-split}, when, for the special case~\eqref{eq-bpdn}, one can consider a splitting of the form~\eqref{eq-fb-split} defining
\eql{\label{eq-bpdn-func}
	\Ff=\frac{1}{2} \norm{A \cdot - y}^2
	\qandq 
	\Gg=\la \norm{\cdot}_1. 
}
%
In the case~\eqref{eq-bpdn-func}, Proposition~\eqref{prop-equiv-sparse-thresh} shows that $\Prox_{\rho J}$ is the soft thresholding.

\section{Example: Sparse Deconvolution}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Sparse Spikes Deconvolution}

Sparse spikes deconvolution makes use of sparsity in the spacial domain, which corresponds to the orthogonal basis of Diracs $\psi_m[n] = \de[n-m]$. This sparsity was first introduced in the seismic imaging community \cite{}, where the signal $f_0$ represent the change of density in the underground and is assumed to be composed of a few Diracs impulse.

In a simplified linearized 1D set-up, ignoring multiple reflexions, the acquisition of underground data $f_0$ is modeled as a convolution $y=h \star f_0 + w$, where $h$ is a so-called ``wavelet'' signal sent in the ground. This should not be confounded with the construction of orthogonal wavelet bases detailed in Chapter \ref{chap-wavelets}, although the term ``wavelet'' originally comes from seismic imaging.

The wavelet filter $h$ is typically a band pass signal that perform a tradeoff between space and frequency concentration especially tailored for seismic exploration. Figure \eqref{fig-spikes-lun} shows a typical wavelet that is a second derivative of a Gaussian, together with its Fourier transform. This shows the large amount of information removed from $f$ during the imaging process.

The sparse $\lun$ regularization in the Dirac basis reads 
\eq{
	 f^\star = \uargmin{f \in \RR^N} \frac{1}{2} \norm{f \star h - y}^2 + \la \sum_m |f_m|.
}
Figure \ref{fig-spikes-lun} shows the result of $\lun$ minimization for a well chosen $\la$ parameter, that was optimized in an oracle manner to minimize the error $\norm{f^\star-f_0}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Sparse Wavelets Deconvolution}


Signal and image acquired by camera always contain some amount of blur because of objects being out of focus, movements in the scene during exposure, and diffraction. A simplifying assumption assumes a spatially invariant blur, so that $\Phi$ is a convolution
\eq{
	y = f_0 \star h + w.
}
In the following, we consider $h$ to be a Gaussian filter of width $\mu > 0$. The number of effective measurements can thus be considered to be $P \sim 1/\mu$, since $\Phi$ nearly set to 0 large enough Fourier frequencies. Table \ref{inverse-deconv} details the implementation of the sparse deconvolution algorithm.

Figures \ref{fig-deconvolution-1d} and \ref{fig-deconvolution-2d} shows examples of signal and image acquisition with Gaussian blur. 

Sobolev regularization \eqref{eq-sobol-reg-fourier} improves over $\ldeux$ regularization \eqref{eq-l2-reg-fourier} because it introduces an uniform smoothing that reduces noise artifact. It however fail to recover sharp edge and thus does a poor job in inverting the operator. To recover sharper transition and edges, one can use either a TV regularization or a sparsity in an orthogonal wavelet basis. 

Figure \ref{fig-deconvolution-1d} shows the improvement obtained in 1D with wavelets with respect to Sobolev. Figure \ref{fig-deconvolution-2d} shows that this improvement is also visible for image deblurring. To obtain a better result with fewer artifact, one can replace the soft thresholding in orthogonal wavelets in during the iteration \eqref{eq-ista-2} by a thresholding in a translation invariant tight frame as defined in \eqref{eq-ti-wavframe}.

Figure \ref{fig-deconvolution-2d-snr} shows the decay of the SNR as a function of the regularization parameter $\la$. This SNR is computed in an oracle manner since it requires the knowledge of $f_0$. The optimal value of $\la$ was used in the reported experiments.

\subsection{Sparse Inpainting}

This section is a follow-up of Section~\ref{sec-inpainting-variational}.

To inpaint using a sparsity prior without noise, we use a small value for $\la$. 
The iterative thresholding algorithm \eqref{eq-ista-2} is written as follow for $\tau=1$,
\eq{
	f^{(k+1)} = \sum_m S_{\la}^{1}( \dotp{ P_y(f^{(k)}) }{\psi_m} )  \psi_m
}
Figure \ref{fig-inpainting-lena} shows the improvevement obtained by the sparse prior over the Sobolev prior if one uses soft thresholding in a translation invariant wavelet frame.
