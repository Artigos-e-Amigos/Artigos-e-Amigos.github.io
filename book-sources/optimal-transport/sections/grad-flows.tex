%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Optimization over Measures}

Example : neural net training, super-resolution, and other functional over measures.

Eulerian vs Lagrangian derivative 
   

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Particle System and Lagrangian Flows}

The intuition : at a Lagrangian OT as $\ell_2$ metric on points. OT flow is a flow on particle locations. 

Gradient descent schemes.

Study of mean field limits.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Wasserstein Gradient Flows}

Implicit stepping. 

Fokker planck, 

Unbalanced gradient flows.

\subsection{Langevin Flows}

1 random particles as opposed to many deterministic particles. Crucial in high dimension.
