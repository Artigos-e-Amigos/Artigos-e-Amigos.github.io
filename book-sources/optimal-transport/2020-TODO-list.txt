*** Reshape section on sinkhorn ***

. Discrete entropic regularisation using H(P)
  H strongly convex, H''=1/P
  Intuition: barrier for P>0, imply P>0 if a,b>0 (otherwise trivial, remove the lines/rows)
. Sinkhorn, proof on support of a and b, explosion for small epsilon
. KL discrete, equivalent reformulation
. Convergence eps->0, eps->+inf
. KL continuous, General formulation, mutual information
. Convergence : KL projection, sub-linear rate with good constant
. Convergence : hilbert metric, linear rate with poor constant (and requires bounded cost)

*** Includes exercises ***
