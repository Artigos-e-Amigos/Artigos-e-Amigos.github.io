\chapter*{Presentation}


The four chapters of this text are independent and present gentle introductions to a few important mathematical foundations of data sciences:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap-shannon} presents Shannon theory of compression, and insists in particular on the entropy bound for coding of information.
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap-images} presents the basics of image processing, in particular some important processings (quantization, densoising, colors).
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap-sparsity} presents sampling theory, from Shannon classical sampling to compressed sensing. It also serves as a gentle introduction to the field of inverse problems regularization.
	\item Chapter~\ref{chap-ot} presents optimal transport and its applications to data sciences.
\end{itemize}
The exposition level for the first two chapters is elementary. The last chapter presents more advanced mathematical concepts and results.
