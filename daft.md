You can retrieve the PDF of the book:

> Gabriel Peyré, [The Discrete Algebra of the Fourier Transform](daft-sources/DAFT-EN.pdf).

The [Latex sources of the book are available](https://github.com/mathematical-tours/mathematical-tours.github.io/tree/master/daft-sources).

It is an english version of the book [l'algèbre discrète de la transformée de Fourier](https://adtf-livre.github.io/). It is a very rough translation, so feel free to submit pull request via GitHub to enhance it.
